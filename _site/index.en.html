          <p>Techniques, strategies and recipes for building a <strong>modern web app</strong> with <strong>multiple teams</strong> that can <strong>ship features independently</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-micro-frontends">What are Micro Frontends?</h2>

<p>The term <strong>Micro Frontends</strong> first came up in <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/micro-frontends">ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</a> at the end of 2016. It extends the concepts of micro services to the frontend world. The current trend is to build a feature-rich and powerful browser application, aka single page app, which sits on top of a micro service architecture. Over time the frontend layer, often developed by a separate team, grows and gets more difficult to maintain. That’s what we call a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU1gXA0rfwc">Frontend Monolith</a>.</p>

<p>The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as <strong>a composition of features</strong> which are owned by <strong>independent teams</strong>. Each team has a <strong>distinct area of business</strong> or <strong>mission</strong> it cares about and specialises in. A team is <strong>cross functional</strong> and develops its features <strong>end-to-end</strong>, from database to user interface.</p>

<p>However, this idea is not new. It has a lot in common with the <a href="http://scs-architecture.org/">Self-contained Systems</a> concept. In the past approaches like this went by the name of <a href="https://dev.otto.de/2014/07/29/scaling-with-microservices-and-vertical-decomposition/">Frontend Integration for Verticalised Systems</a>. But Micro Frontends is clearly a more friendly and less bulky term.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-modern-web-app">What’s a Modern Web App?</h2>

<p>In the introduction I’ve used the phrase “building a modern web app”. Let’s define the assumptions that are connected with this term.</p>

<p>To put this into a broader perspective, <a href="https://ar.al/">Aral Balkan</a> has written a blog post about what he calls the <a href="https://ar.al/notes/the-documents-to-applications-continuum/">Documents‐to‐Applications Continuum</a>. He comes up with the concept of a sliding scale where a site, built out of <strong>static documents</strong>, connected via links, is <strong>on the left</strong> end and a pure behaviour driven, <strong>contentless application</strong> like an online photo editor is <strong>on the right</strong>.</p>

<p>If you would position your project on the <strong>left side of this spectrum</strong>, an <strong>integration on webserver level</strong> is a good fit. With this model a server collects and <strong>concatenates HTML strings</strong> from all components that make up the page requested by the user. Updates are done by reloading the page from the server or replacing parts of it via ajax. <a href="https://twitter.com/gustaf_nk/">Gustaf Nilsson Kotte</a> has written a <a href="https://gustafnk.github.io/microservice-websites/">comprehensive article</a> on this topic.</p>

<p>When your user interface has to provide <strong>instant feedback</strong>, even on unreliable connections, a pure server rendered site is not sufficient anymore. To implement techniques like <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/true-lies-of-optimistic-user-interfaces/">Optimistic UI</a> or <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1797">Skeleton Screens</a> you need to be able to also <strong>update</strong> your UI <strong>on the device itself</strong>. Google’s term <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web Apps</a> aptly describes the <strong>balancing act</strong> of being a good citizen of the web (progressive enhancement) while also providing app-like performance. This kind of application is located somewhere <strong>around the middle of the site-app-continuum</strong>. Here a solely server based solution is not sufficient anymore. We have to move the <strong>integration into the browser</strong>, and this is the focus of this article.</p>

<h2 id="core-ideas-behind-micro-frontends">Core Ideas behind Micro Frontends</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be Technology Agnostic</strong><br />Each team should be able to choose and upgrade their stack without having to coordinate with other teams. <a href="#the-dom-is-the-api">Custom Elements</a> are a great way to hide implementation details while providing a neutral interface to others.</li>
  <li><strong>Isolate Team Code</strong><br />Don’t share a runtime, even if all teams use the same framework. Build independent apps that are self contained. Don’t rely on shared state or global variables.</li>
  <li><strong>Establish Team Prefixes</strong><br />Agree on naming conventions where isolation is not possible yet. Namespace CSS, Events, Local Storage and Cookies to avoid collisions and clarify ownership.</li>
  <li><strong>Favor Native Browser Features over Custom APIs</strong><br />Use <a href="#parent-child-communication--dom-modification">Browser Events for communication</a> instead of building a global PubSub system. If you really have to build a cross team API, try keeping it as simple as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Build a Resilient Site</strong><br />Your feature should be useful, even if JavaScript failed or hasn’t executed yet. Use <a href="#serverside-rendering--universal-rendering">Universal Rendering</a> and Progressive Enhancement to improve perceived performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-dom-is-the-api">The DOM is the API</h2>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/customelements">Custom Elements</a>, the interoperability aspect from the Web Components Spec, are a good primitive for integration in the browser. Each team builds their component <strong>using their web technology of choice</strong> and <strong>wraps it inside a Custom Element</strong> (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;order-minicart&gt;&lt;/order-minicart&gt;</code>). The DOM specification of this particular element (tag-name, attributes &amp; events) acts as the contract or public API for other teams. The advantage is that they can use the component and its functionality without having to know the implementation. They just have to be able to interact with the DOM.</p>

<p>But Custom Elements alone are not the solution to all our needs. To address progressive enhancement, universal rendering or routing we need additional pieces of software.</p>

<p>This page is divided into two main areas. First we will discuss <a href="#page-composition">Page Composition</a> - how to assemble a page out of components owned by different teams. After that we’ll show examples for implementing clientside <a href="#page-transition">Page Transition</a>.</p>

<h2 id="page-composition">Page Composition</h2>

<p>Beside the <strong>client-</strong> and <strong>serverside</strong> integration of code written in <strong>different frameworks</strong> itself, there are a lot of side topics that should be discussed: mechanisms to <strong>isolate js</strong>, <strong>avoid css conflicts</strong>, <strong>load resources</strong> as needed, <strong>share common resources</strong> between teams, handle <strong>data fetching</strong> and think about good <strong>loading states</strong> for the user. We’ll go into these topics one step at a time.</p>

<h3 id="the-base-prototype">The Base Prototype</h3>

<p>The product page of this model tractor store will serve as the basis for the following examples.</p>

<p>It features a <strong>variant selector</strong> to switch between the three different tractor models. On change product image, name, price and recommendations are updated. There is also a <strong>buy button</strong>, which adds the selected variant to the basket and a <strong>mini basket</strong> at the top that updates accordingly.</p>

<p><a href="./0-model-store/"><img src="/ressources/video/model-store-0.gif" alt="Example 0 - Product Page - Plain JS" /></a></p>

<p><a href="./0-model-store/">try in browser</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/neuland/micro-frontends/tree/master/0-model-store">inspect the code</a></p>

<p>All HTML is generated client side using <strong>plain JavaScript</strong> and ES6 Template Strings with <strong>no dependencies</strong>. The code uses a simple state/markup separation and re-renders the entire HTML client side on every change - no fancy DOM diffing and <strong>no universal rendering</strong> for now. Also <strong>no team separation</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/neuland/micro-frontends/tree/master/0-model-store">the code</a> is written in one js/css file.</p>

<h3 id="clientside-integration">Clientside Integration</h3>

<p>In this example, the page is split into separate components/fragments owned by three teams. <strong>Team Checkout</strong> (blue) is now responsible for everything regarding the purchasing process - namely the <strong>buy button</strong> and <strong>mini basket</strong>. <strong>Team Inspire</strong> (green) manages the <strong>product recommendations</strong> on this page. The page itself is owned by <strong>Team Product</strong> (red).</p>

<p><a href="./1-composition-client-only/"><img src="/ressources/screen/three-teams.png" alt="Example 1 - Product Page - Composition" /></a></p>

<p><a href="./1-composition-client-only/">try in browser</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/neuland/micro-frontends/tree/master/1-composition-client-only">inspect the code</a></p>

<p><strong>Team Product</strong> decides which functionality is included and where it is positioned in the layout. The page contains information that can be provided by Team Product itself, like the product name, image and the available variants. But it also includes fragments (Custom Elements) from the other teams.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-a-custom-element">How to Create a Custom Element?</h3>

<p>Lets take the <strong>buy button</strong> as an example. Team Product includes the button simply adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;blue-buy sku="t_porsche"&gt;&lt;/blue-buy&gt;</code> to the desired position in the markup. For this to work, Team Checkout has to register the element <code class="highlighter-rouge">blue-buy</code> on the page.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class BlueBuy extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.innerHTML = `&lt;button type="button"&gt;buy for 66,00 €&lt;/button&gt;`;
  }
  disconnectedCallback() { ... }
}
window.customElements.define('blue-buy', BlueBuy);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now every time the browser comes across a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">blue-buy</code> tag, the constructor is called. <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> is the reference to the root DOM node of the custom element. All properties and methods of a standard DOM element like <code class="highlighter-rouge">innerHTML</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">getAttribute()</code> can be used.</p>

<p><img src="/ressources/video/custom-element.gif" alt="Custom Element in Action" /></p>

<p>When naming your element the only requirement the spec defines is that the name must <strong>include a dash (-)</strong> to maintain compatibility with upcoming new HTML tags. In the upcoming examples the naming convention <code class="highlighter-rouge">[team_color]-[feature]</code> is used. The team namespace guards against collisions and this way the ownership of a feature becomes obvious, simply by looking at the DOM.</p>

<h3 id="parent-child-communication--dom-modification">Parent-Child Communication / DOM Modification</h3>

<p>When the user selects another tractor in the <strong>variant selector</strong>, the <strong>buy button has to be updated</strong> accordingly. To achieve this Team Product can simply <strong>remove</strong> the existing element from the DOM <strong>and insert</strong> a new one.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>container.innerHTML;
// =&gt; &lt;blue-buy sku="t_porsche"&gt;...&lt;/blue-buy&gt;
container.innerHTML = '&lt;blue-buy sku="t_fendt"&gt;&lt;/blue-buy&gt;';
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">disconnectedCallback</code> of the old element gets invoked synchronously to provide the element with the chance to clean up things like event listeners. After that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">constructor</code> of the newly created <code class="highlighter-rouge">t_fendt</code> element is called.</p>

<p>Another more performant option is to just update the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sku</code> attribute on the existing element.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>document.querySelector('blue-buy').setAttribute('sku', 't_fendt');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If Team Product used a templating engine that features DOM diffing, like React, this would be done by the algorithm automatically.</p>

<p><img src="/ressources/video/custom-element-attribute.gif" alt="Custom Element Attribute Change" /></p>

<p>To support this the Custom Element can implement the <code class="highlighter-rouge">attributeChangedCallback</code> and specify a list of <code class="highlighter-rouge">observedAttributes</code> for which this callback should be triggered.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const prices = {
  t_porsche: '66,00 €',
  t_fendt: '54,00 €',
  t_eicher: '58,00 €',
};

class BlueBuy extends HTMLElement {
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ['sku'];
  }
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.render();
  }
  render() {
    const sku = this.getAttribute('sku');
    const price = prices[sku];
    this.innerHTML = `&lt;button type="button"&gt;buy for ${price}&lt;/button&gt;`;
  }
  attributeChangedCallback(attr, oldValue, newValue) {
    this.render();
  }
  disconnectedCallback() {...}
}
window.customElements.define('blue-buy', BlueBuy);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To avoid duplication a <code class="highlighter-rouge">render()</code> method is introduced which is called from <code class="highlighter-rouge">constructor</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">attributeChangedCallback</code>. This method collects needed data and innerHTML’s the new markup. When deciding to go with a more sophisticated templating engine or framework inside the Custom Element, this is the place where its initialisation code would go.</p>

<h3 id="browser-support">Browser Support</h3>

<p>The above example uses the Custom Element V1 Spec which is currently <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1">supported in Chrome, Safari and Opera</a>. But with <a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element">document-register-element</a> a lightweight and battle-tested polyfill is available to make this work in all browsers. Under the hood, it uses the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=mutationobserver">widely supported</a> Mutation Observer API, so there is no hacky DOM tree watching going on in the background.</p>

<h3 id="framework-compatibility">Framework Compatibility</h3>

<p>Because Custom Elements are a web standard, all major JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React, Preact, Vue or Hyperapp support them. But when you get into the details, there are still a few implementation problems in some frameworks. At <a href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/">Custom Elements Everywhere</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_dodson">Rob Dodson</a> has put together a compatibility test suite that highlights unresolved issues.</p>

<h3 id="child-parent-or-siblings-communication--dom-events">Child-Parent or Siblings Communication / DOM Events</h3>

<p>But passing down attributes is not sufficient for all interactions. In our example the <strong>mini basket should refresh</strong> when the user performs a <strong>click on the buy button</strong>.</p>

<p>Both fragments are owned by Team Checkout (blue), so they could build some kind of internal JavaScript API that lets the mini basket know when the button was pressed. But this would require the component instances to know each other and would also be an isolation violation.</p>

<p>A cleaner way is to use a PubSub mechanism, where a component can publish a message and other components can subscribe to specific topics. Luckily browsers have this feature built-in. This is exactly how browser events like <code class="highlighter-rouge">click</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">mouseover</code> work. In addition to native events there is also the possibility to create higher level events with <code class="highlighter-rouge">new CustomEvent(...)</code>. Events are always tied to the DOM node they were created/dispatched on. Most native events also feature bubbling. This makes it possible to listen for all events on a specific sub-tree of the DOM. If you want to listen to all events on the page, attach the event listener to the window element. Here is how the creation of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">blue:basket:changed</code>-event looks in the example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class BlueBuy extends HTMLElement {
  [...]
  connectedCallback() {
    [...]
    this.render();
    this.firstChild.addEventListener('click', this.addToCart);
  }
  addToCart() {
    // maybe talk to an api
    this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('blue:basket:changed', {
      bubbles: true,
    }));
  }
  render() {
    this.innerHTML = `&lt;button type="button"&gt;buy&lt;/button&gt;`;
  }
  disconnectedCallback() {
    this.firstChild.removeEventListener('click', this.addToCart);
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The mini basket can now subscribe to this event on <code class="highlighter-rouge">window</code> and get notified when it should refresh its data.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class BlueBasket extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    [...]
    window.addEventListener('blue:basket:changed', this.refresh);
  }
  refresh() {
    // fetch new data and render it
  }
  disconnectedCallback() {
    window.removeEventListener('blue:basket:changed', this.refresh);
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this approach the mini basket fragment adds a listener to a DOM element which is outside its scope (<code class="highlighter-rouge">window</code>). This should be ok for many applications, but if you are uncomfortable with this you could also implement an approach where the page itself (Team Product) listens to the event and notifies the mini basket by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">refresh()</code> on the DOM element.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// page.js
const $ = document.getElementsByTagName;

$('blue-buy')[0].addEventListener('blue:basket:changed', function() {
  $('blue-basket')[0].refresh();
});
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Imperatively calling DOM methods is quite uncommon, but can be found in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video#Controlling_media_playback">video element api</a> for example. If possible the use of the declarative approach (attribute change) should be preferred.</p>

<h2 id="serverside-rendering--universal-rendering">Serverside Rendering / Universal Rendering</h2>

<p>Custom Elements are great for integrating components inside the browser. But when building a site that is accessible on the web, chances are that initial load performance matters and users will see a white screen until all js frameworks are downloaded and executed. Additionally, it’s good to think about what happens to the site if the JavaScript fails or is blocked. <a href="https://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a> explains the importance in his ebook/podcast <a href="https://resilientwebdesign.com/">Resilient Web Design</a>. Therefore the ability to render the core content on the server is key. Sadly the web component spec does not talk about server rendering at all. No JavaScript, no Custom Elements :(</p>

<h3 id="custom-elements--server-side-includes--️">Custom Elements + Server Side Includes = ❤️</h3>

<p>To make server rendering work, the previous example is refactored. Each team has their own express server and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">render()</code> method of the Custom Element is also accessible via url.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/blue-buy?sku=t_porsche
&lt;button type="button"&gt;buy for 66,00 €&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Custom Element tag name is used as the path name - attributes become query parameters. Now there is a way to server-render the content of every component. In combination with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;blue-buy&gt;</code>-Custom Elements something that is quite close to a <strong>Universal Web Component</strong> is achieved:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;blue-buy sku="t_porsche"&gt;
  &lt;!--#include virtual="/blue-buy?sku=t_porsche" --&gt;
&lt;/blue-buy&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">#include</code> comment is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes">Server Side Includes</a>, which is a feature that is available in most web servers. Yes, it’s the same technique used back in the days to embed the current date on our web sites. There are also a few alternative techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Side_Includes">ESI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Schibsted-Tech-Polska/nodesi">nodesi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tes/compoxure">compoxure</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tailor">tailor</a>, but for our projects SSI has proven itself as a simple and incredibly stable solution.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">#include</code> comment is replaced with the response of <code class="highlighter-rouge">/blue-buy?sku=t_porsche</code> before the web server sends the complete page to the browser. The configuration in nginx looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>upstream team_blue {
  server team_blue:3001;
}
upstream team_green {
  server team_green:3002;
}
upstream team_red {
  server team_red:3003;
}

server {
  listen 3000;
  ssi on;

  location /blue {
    proxy_pass  http://team_blue;
  }
  location /green {
    proxy_pass  http://team_green;
  }
  location /red {
    proxy_pass  http://team_red;
  }
  location / {
    proxy_pass  http://team_red;
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The directive <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssi: on;</code> enables the SSI feature and an <code class="highlighter-rouge">upstream</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">location</code> block is added for every team to ensure that all urls which start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">/blue</code> will be routed to the correct application (<code class="highlighter-rouge">team_blue:3001</code>). In addition the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> route is mapped to team red, which is controlling the homepage / product page.</p>

<p>This animation shows the tractor store in a browser which has <strong>JavaScript disabled</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="./ressources/video/server-render.mp4"><img src="/ressources/video/server-render.gif" alt="Serverside Rendering - Disabled JavaScript" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/neuland/micro-frontends/tree/master/2-composition-universal">inspect the code</a></p>

<p>The variant selection buttons now are actual links and every click leads to a reload of the page. The terminal on the right illustrates the process of how a request for a page is routed to team red, which controls the product page and after that the markup is supplemented by the fragments from team blue and green.</p>

<p>When switching JavaScript back on, only the server log messages for the first request will be visible. All subsequent tractor changes are handled client side, just like in the first example. In a later example the product data will be extracted from the JavaScript and loaded via a REST api as needed.</p>

<p>You can play with this sample code on your local machine. Only <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a> needs to be installed.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/neuland/micro-frontends.git
cd micro-frontends/2-composition-universal
docker-compose up --build
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Docker then starts the nginx on port 3000 and builds the node.js image for each team. When you open <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/">http://127.0.0.1:3000/</a> in your browser you should see a red tractor. The combined log of <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> makes it easy to see what is going on in the network. Sadly there is no way to control the output color, so you have to endure the fact that team blue might be highlighted in green :)</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">src</code> files are mapped into the individual containers and the node application will restart when you make a code change. Changing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx.conf</code> requires a restart of <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> in order to have an effect. So feel free to fiddle around and give feedback.</p>

<h3 id="data-fetching--loading-states">Data Fetching &amp; Loading States</h3>

<p>A downside of the SSI/ESI approach is, that the <strong>slowest fragment determines the response time</strong> of the whole page.
So it’s good when the response of a fragment can be cached.
For fragments that are expensive to produce and hard to cache it’s often a good idea to exclude them from the initial render.
They can be loaded asynchronously in the browser.
In our example the <code class="highlighter-rouge">green-recos</code> fragment, that shows personalized recommendations is a candidate for this.</p>

<p>One possible solution would be that team red just skips the SSI Include.</p>

<p><strong>Before</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;green-recos sku="t_porsche"&gt;
  &lt;!--#include virtual="/green-recos?sku=t_porsche" --&gt;
&lt;/green-recos&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>After</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;green-recos sku="t_porsche"&gt;&lt;/green-recos&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Important Side-note: Custom Elements <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/building-components/customelements#jsapi">cannot be self-closing</a>, so writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;green-recos sku="t_porsche" /&gt;</code> would not work correctly.</em></p>

<p>The rendering only takes place in the browser.
But, as can be seen in the animation, this change has now introduced a <strong>substantial reflow</strong> of the page.
The recommendation area is initially blank.
Team greens JavaScript is loaded and executed.
The API call for fetching the personalized recommendation is made.
The recommendation markup is rendered and the associated images are requested.
The fragment now needs more space and pushes the layout of the page.</p>

<p>There are different options to avoid an annoying reflow like this.
Team red, which controls the page, could <strong>fixate the recommendation containers height</strong>.
On a responsive website its often tricky to determine the height, because it could differ for different screen sizes.
But the more important issue is, that <strong>this kind of inter-team agreement creates a tight coupling</strong> between team red and green.
If team green wants to introduce an additional sub-headline in the reco element, it would have to coordinate with team red on the new height.
Both teams would have to rollout their changes simultaneously to avoid a broken layout.</p>

<p>A better way is to use a technique called <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/luke-wroblewski-introduced-skeleton-screens-in-2013-through-his-work-on-the-polar-app-later-fd1d32a6a8e7">Skeleton Screens</a>.
Team red leaves the <code class="highlighter-rouge">green-recos</code> SSI Include in the markup.
In addition team green changes the <strong>server-side render method</strong> of its fragment so that it produces a <strong>schematic version of the content</strong>.
The <strong>skeleton markup</strong> can reuse parts of the real content’s layout styles.
This way it <strong>reserves the needed space</strong> and the fill-in of the actual content does not lead to a jump.</p>

<p><img alt="Skeleton Screen" src="./ressources/video/data-fetching-skeleton.gif" style="width: 500px" /></p>

<p>Skeleton screens are also <strong>very useful for client rendering</strong>.
When your custom element is inserted into the DOM due to a user action it could <strong>instantly render the skeleton</strong> until the data it needs from the server has arrived.</p>

<p>Even on an <strong>attribute change</strong> like for the <em>variant select</em> you can decide to switch to skeleton view until the new data arrives.
This ways the user gets an indication that something is going on in the fragment.
But when your endpoint responds quickly a short <strong>skeleton flicker</strong> between the old and new data could also be annoying.
Preserving the old data or using intelligent timeouts can help.
So use this technique wisely and try to get user feedback.</p>
